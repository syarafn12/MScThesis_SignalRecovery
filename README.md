# Thesis Title: Assessing Forest Recovery Following Selective Logging-related Tropical Forest Disturbances using Sentinel-1 Radar Data

This repository contains all the code used for my MSc thesis, which was completed and successfully defended in March 2024. 
*The thesis report is available in the Wageningen University library. I recently uploaded the code to GitHub and plan to make some modifications to improve the scripts.*

## Objective
This research aims to understand the signal recovery, particularly fine-scale selective logging-related disturbances, including logging roads and logging events detected by the RADD Alert system in four districts in Teluk Bintuni, West Papua, Indonesia.


# Research questions
1.  *Does the backscatter signal recover to a similar pre-disturbance level, and what is the recovery duration?*

**Short answer:** The analysis reveals that at least the top 25% data of the backscatter signal has indeed recovered to a level similar to that of the pre-disturbance period. In Descending VV polarization, the upper 25% of data fully recovered within four months, while in Descending VH, the upper data full recovery occurred after two years. 

2. *How do the side-looking radar geometry and spatial orientation of disturbance events (e.g., roads) affect signal recovery?*

**Short answer:** Side looking radar refers s to polarization, orbit and geometry effects such as shadowing and foreshortening. spatial orientation includes factors such as the layout of logging roads (including skid roads) and the orientation of logging events and logging roads. The road edges recover more quickly in several areas than in the interior, and the large-sized logging events take longer to recover compared to smaller-scale logging events.

3. *Can recovery metrics be used to characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of signal recovery?*

**Short answer:** Yes, recovery metrics can be used to characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of signal recovery. Each of the three recovery metrics provides unique insights into different aspects of post-disturbance recovery.
